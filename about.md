Hello! My name is Timur, I am a Software Engineer based in Berlin.
I help startups and companies to grow fast by implementing their dreams into
robust features in `Ruby` and `Elixir`.

Currently I work as a backend developer at [Adjust](https://adjust.com),
where I am responsible for development of a dashboard, which is used by clients
to analyse KPIs of their marketing campaigns.

Before I was working at
[Lobster.media](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lobster#section-overview),
where I was developing a photo search engine and various
microservices for image recognition, data processing and storing.
I also did performance optimization, partners integration, development of a public API.

You can find my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mendab1e). There are several
little tools and libraries which I've built in my free time.
Whenever it is possible, I also contribute to open source projects.

In my free time I enjoy traveling, cycling, taking photos, playing video games,
searching local flea markets for records from 70s and attending music concerts.
